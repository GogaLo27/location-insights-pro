# Google Branding Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Contact Sales Button Fixed
**Problem:** The "Contact Sales" button was incorrectly using Google sign-in instead of linking to the contact page.

**Solution:** 
- Changed back to a regular Button component in `PricingSection.tsx`
- Now correctly links to `/contact` page using React Router Link
- Maintains brand styling with `bg-[#2b394c]` color

**Location:** Bottom of pricing section ("Need a custom solution?" area)

### 2. ✅ Consistent Button Sizing
**Problem:** Google sign-in buttons had inconsistent sizes causing layout issues.

**Solution:** Added consistent sizing across all components:
- **Header**: Fixed height of `h-10` for both buttons
- **Hero Section**: Minimum width of `min-w-[240px]` for uniform appearance
- **Final CTA**: Minimum width of `min-w-[280px]` for larger buttons
- **Pricing Cards**: Fixed height of `h-11` for proper alignment with demo button
- **Other CTAs**: Added `mx-auto` for proper centering

### 3. ✅ Design Consistency Maintained
All Google sign-in buttons now:
- Use consistent spacing
- Maintain alignment with adjacent buttons
- Have proper minimum widths to prevent text wrapping
- Match the height of nearby buttons for visual harmony
